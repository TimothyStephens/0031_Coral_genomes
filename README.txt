# Basic analysis of available coral genomes

This repository is for scripts, results, and documentation relating to the basic analysis of avaliable coral genome data (e.g., BUSCO analysis, genome stats, etc.).

The `01_Data/2021-12-03` directory contains information about the raw data that is used in this analysis.
the `01_Data/2021-12-03/coral` directory contains information about the location and pre-processing of coral genomes and transcriptomes (plus out group species) that were downloaded for use in this analysis.

The `04_Results/2022-02-03` directory contains two markdown files:
 - `README_genomes.md` details the analysis performed on each of the genomes
 - `README_transcriptomes.md` details the analysis performed on each of the transcriptomes

Bash scripts that were used to actually perform the analysis are the relveant sub-directories and follow the general naming format: `run*.sh`. The log files produced by these bashs scripts are generally called `run*.sh.log*`.
